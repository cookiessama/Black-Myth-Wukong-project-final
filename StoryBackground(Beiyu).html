            <h3>Settings</h3>
            <p>The game is inspired by the classical Chinese novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West" style="color: orange;">Journey to the West</a> and follows an anthropomorphic monkey based on Sun Wukong from the novel.</p>
            <p>It has six chapters, each focusing on a specific location: Black Wind Mountain, Yellow Wind Ridge, The New West, The Webbed Hollow, Flaming Mountains, and Mount Huaguo.</p>
            <p>The game is set in a world with gods from the Chinese pantheon, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism " style="color: orange;">Buddhist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism " style="color: orange;">Daoist</a>, and other deities. Many yaoguais (monsters), who are beings with preternatural abilities and strange appearances, inhabit this world.</p>
            <p>The game introduces cultural and natural landmarks derived from the real world into its setting. It features, for example, several locations from Shanxi Province, such as the Yungang Grottoes, Little Western Paradise, Nanchan Temple, Iron Buddha Temple, Guangsheng Temple, and Stork Tower, as well as locations from other provinces, such as the Kaiyuan Temple in Fujian Province.</p>
            <p>Each chapter concludes with an animated cutscene providing a reflection and exploration of the narrative and thematic elements of Black Myth Wukong. For instance, the first three cutscenes resonate with Chinese philosophy, while the fourth cutscene relates to a universal theme of love. </p>

            <h3>Story Line</h3>
            <p>After escorting his master Tang Sanzang and retrieving the Buddhist scriptures, Sun Wukong ascends to Buddhahood but chooses a simple life on Mount Huaguo over the Celestial Court, which leads to his imprisonment in stone by Erlang Shen. Centuries later, a monkey known as "The Destined One" sets out to recover six relics scattered across the mortal realm to revive Wukong. Along his journey, he faces various foes, including the Black Bear Guai, Yellow Wind Sage, and Red Boy, while gathering relics with the help of allies like Zhu Bajie. Ultimately, after confronting Erlang Shen and obtaining Wukong's armor, the Destined One learns that he must inherit Wukong's legacy rather than restore him entirely. In the end, he either becomes trapped in stone like Wukong or retains his memories and freedom, depending on the choices made during the adventure.</p>
